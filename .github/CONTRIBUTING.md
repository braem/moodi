# Contributing

Contributing is simple: add your work to your fork of this project and open a pull request.

If your pull request does not fully or partially solve any open issue, it is strongly encouraged that you open an issue first.
This is the ensure the fix or feature's validity beforehand.

Besides that the only other requirement is to make sure your commits follow [convential commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)!
